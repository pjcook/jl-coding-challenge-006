/*
 @gareth rowlands
 Looks like you understood it to me!
 
 You named functions T -> Bool as 'Filter' but they are commonly known as predicates, so you could consider changing your typealias.
 
 I don't think you use InputType, do you?
 
 Why not add a unit test framework and make some unit tests with assertions?
 
 Can you make myFilter recursive? What are the consequences?
